# 3D Mesh Transformation with PyTorch3D 🌐🔍

## Overview

This repository showcases a Python implementation for transforming a 3D model of a sphere into a cube using PyTorch3D and gradient descent optimization. The exercise provides a practical demonstration of basic PyTorch3D usage for manipulating 3D meshes. 💻

## Files and Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the main implementation for loading 3D models, setting up optimization, and training the model. 📄
- `plot.py`: Helper file for visualizing 3D meshes. 📊
- `assets/`: Folder containing the sphere and cube OBJ files. 📁



## Execution

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/3D-Mesh-Transform-PyTorch3D.git
cd 3D-Mesh-Transform-PyTorch3D
```

2. Install dependencies: Ensure you have pytorch3d installed for the project. More details regarding the installation process can be found here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/INSTALL.md

3. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. View the results in a 3D visualization tool such as Blender or MeshLab.

## Results

After running the program, you can inspect the transformed 3D mesh in the visualization tool of your choice. The final result should resemble a cube optimized from the initial sphere.

Feel free to explore and modify the code for further experimentation with PyTorch3D's capabilities in 3D mesh manipulation. 🚀
